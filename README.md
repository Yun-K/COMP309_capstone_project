Follow the requirement, in which `report.pdf` is in the root directory, and within the `code` directory, there are `model.pth`, `train.py` ,`test.py`and empty `testdata` directory. There are also lots of other files such as .ipynb, which can be ignored. 

Through the test on my pc, test.py works when the command `python test.py` is typed into the terminal. It will load the model.pth and read the images from testdata directory for testing. The correct classified images, total images, and the accuracy will output to the terminal.

| Test Performance      |                                                              | 11.50 / 15 |
| Code                  |                                                              | A          |
| Introduction          | Why CNN?                                                     | 3 / 4      |
| Problem Investigation | Performance before preprocessing?                            | 12 / 15    |
| Methodology           | Have touched 6 items out of the 9 suggested ones (the given marks consider all of them). For some items, either lack of comparisons with alternatives or why the approach/setting is better than the alternatives is not very clear. | 24 / 30    |
| Results               | Yes, good, although it could be structured in a more straightforward way than the screenshots inserted in various ways - a bit hard to know what to attend to. | 6.5 / 7    |
| Conclusion            | Conclusion is not that you did well, but that CNN > MLP performance on this data!  Otherwise, these are nice ideas. | 3 / 4      |
| Final                 |                                                              | 81.75 / 75 |
