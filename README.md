Follow the requirement, in which `report.pdf` is in the root directory, and within the `code` directory, there are `model.pth`, `train.py` ,`test.py`and empty `testdata` directory. There are also lots of other files such as .ipynb, which can be ignored. 

Through the test on my pc, test.py works when the command `python test.py` is typed into the terminal. It will load the model.pth and read the images from testdata directory for testing. The correct classified images, total images, and the accuracy will output to the terminal.
